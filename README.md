# Workit Landing Page 🚀

Hello everyone! 👋 After a long break, I'm back to learning frontend development at full throttle, filled with positive energy! 🌟 I decided to use this motivation to refresh what I've learned so far by tackling a project from Frontend Mentor.

## Project Description 📝

This project is an implementation of the **Workit Landing Page**, a challenge from Frontend Mentor. This challenge allowed me to assess where my skills currently stand and how much knowledge I retained during my break. It's a great opportunity for me to practice and refine my skills, especially in the area of breakpoints and responsive design.

## Technologies and Tools 🛠️

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **SCSS** (I'm refreshing my basics and exploring more advanced features)
- **Responsive Design** (I'm working on improving my skills in creating responsive layouts)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version control and project publishing)

## My Experience 🎯

I chose this challenge to get a better understanding of where I currently am in my frontend learning journey. Although I'm still very much a beginner, I feel that with each project, I'm taking a step forward! 🚶‍♂️

I'm currently learning from courses on Udemy by Majk, as well as courses on his private platform. It's thanks to these courses that I've been able to reach my current level and understand the fundamentals of frontend development.

## What's Next? 🌱

I know I still have a lot to learn, but I'm ready to take on every challenge. 📚 My main goals for the near future are:

- Working on correctly applying breakpoints in responsive design.
- Improving my ability to write clean and modular SCSS.
- Exploring JavaScript to add more interactivity to my projects.

Every new project is another step towards becoming a more competent front-end developer. 🚀
